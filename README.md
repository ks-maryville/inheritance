SWDV 660 Week 3 - Inheritance

For this exercise, we want you to code a generic superclass and at least three subclasses of that superclass, each class needs to have at least 2 attributes and 2 methods. Itâ€™s easiest to simply describe a real-world object in this manner.  You need to provide a test method that shows your classes in operation.

 

I would highly suggest that you look at week 8 and the final project.   You should pick a system for your week 8 project now and start building using this assignment as a base.
